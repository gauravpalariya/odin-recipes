    <h2>A Very Delicious Indian Dish</h2>

    <p><strong>Homemade paneer</strong> is marinated in a spicy chili garlic marinade which adds a wonderful flavor to this versatile Indian cheese. Pan-frying the <em>paneer</em> gives it delightful texture.</p>

    <p>I’ve wanted to share this simple, chili garlic paneer recipe for a while, since, as I joked about in the video, people just aren’t eating enough fried cheese these days, but on a serious note,<br> the real motivation was to make sure everyone knows about this versatile Indian cheese, and how easy it is to make yourself.</p>

    <div class="ingredients-part">

    </div>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk in a large pot on between medium and medium-high heat to 195 degrees F to 205 degrees F (90 to 9 degrees C) until milk is almost simmering.<br> Reduce heat to low, and stir in yogurt and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Stir for about 30 seconds, and if milk isn’t separating into curds and whey, stir in another<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice.</li><br>
        <li>Once curds form, turn off heat, and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and cool mixture. Pour curds into a cheesecloth or a cotton towel lined <br>colander and drain out whey. Whey can be reserved for other uses.</li><br>
        <li>Let curds sit and drain for 5 to 10 minutes, before gathering up the cloth, and squeezing out excess liquid. Be careful to not burn yourself, as the liquid may<br> still be very hot. Press curds between layers of cloth into a disc of about 2 inches high, being careful not to leave excess cloth bunched up on top, or underneath<br> the cheese. Place something flat over the cheese, and place a heavy pan on top to weigh down. Leave paneer under the weight until very firm to the touch, 30 to<br> 90 minutes. Wrap and refrigerate until well chilled before using.</li><br>
        <li>For the chili garlic marinade combine garlic, Scriracha, yogurt. lemon juice, garam masala, and kosher salt in a bowl; mix until well combined.</li><br>
        <li>Cut paneer into squares or rectangles about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, and add to the marinade, tossing well to coat thoroughly on both sides. Wrap and marinate<br> paneer for at least 4 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Combine yogurt, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt for the yogurt dipping sauce in a blender; blend until smooth.</li><br>
        <li>Melt butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and pan-fry paneer until well browned, about 2 minutes per side. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
